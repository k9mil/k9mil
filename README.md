# Hi, I'm Kamil. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 24 year old full-stack software engineer and designer, striving to create unique and innovative solutions to modern-day problems. I accomplish this mostly by working with Python, TypeScript, React and Tailwind.

## Current

Currently, I am working at [Barclays](https://home.barclays/), a multinational universal bank where I work on a greenfield payment tracking initiative â€” a critical system providing real-time visibility across financial systems, with a focus on establishing centralised payment operations intelligence.

In my free time I'm building [allocate](https://github.com/allocate-planner), an AI-powered voice-first day planning platform with deep development tool integrations.
