# Hi, I'm Kamil. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 24 year old full-stack software engineer and designer, striving to create unique and innovative solutions to modern-day problems. I accomplish this mostly by working with Python, TypeScript, React and Tailwind.

## Current

Currently, I am working at [Barclays](https://home.barclays/), a multinational universal bank where I work on our core data platform â€” a critical system serving as the single source of truth across the bank, with a focus on modernising the platform.
