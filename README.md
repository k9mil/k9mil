## Hey there, I'm Kamil 👋.

### 🎯 Current

I'm currently working on **[statum](https://github.com/k9mil/statum)** — it's a super easy to use website which allows anyone with a twitch account to get real-time data of their followed twitch streamers. I'm also currently learning [Go](https://golang.org/).
